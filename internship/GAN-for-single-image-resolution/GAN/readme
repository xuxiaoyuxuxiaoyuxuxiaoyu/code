An Iterative Optimization Method for Single Image Super-Resolution With AutoEncoder
__author__:xuxiaoyu
Clues abstract:
1.Use an encode-decode manner to super resolve low-resolution images
2.Encoder is trained with general downsampling Network, decoder is fine-tuned from EDSR
3.Iteration Algorithm--
4.Utilize high-level vison loss to enhance the performance which include style-loss content-loss perceptual-loss vgg-loss
5.Utilize adversial training to decrease the logliklihood of two different distributions
6.Use AAE to cluster different patches and define their distances.The distances are then imported into decoder to guide the SR procession
another annovation:different patches are projected into different codes Z(low resolution images) and style S, ecah zi represents the manifold and si indicates the images it may be. in inference stage another Bicubic encoder is used to optimize the output to a constrained spherical region 
Note:encoder need to be tested on one-dimension data to fit Bicubic interpolating
